While working or studying, we can all get carried away and sit too long. This application is created for health care. At startup (you need to configure the system environment variables to launch the application via the "mtmr" command), a frame opens, when closing which the application closes. 

Periodically (by default 1 hour) a new frame will open and an audio alert will be activated. This means that you need to get up and stretch, look at the removed objects (so that your eyes rest), preferably get some fresh air.

The frequency can be adjusted. To do this, enter the input parameters -s -m -h (seconds, minutes and hours, respectively) into the command line. The parameters are summed up.
